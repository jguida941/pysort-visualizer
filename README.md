# 🧩 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A production-grade, research-friendly PyQt6 visualizer for sorting algorithms and data structures **built for educators, students, and curious engineers** to explore algorithms through visual, step-by-step interaction, because seeing is the best way to learn.

Every animation frame is backed by an explicit stream of Step records, ensuring deterministic replay, reproducible metrics, and faithful narration of each operation.

**From bubble to radix and timsort: compare, replay, and measure a full suite of algorithms in one PyQt6 desktop tool.**

## Highlights

- **Instrumented algorithms**: Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Shell, Heap, Comb, Cocktail, Quick (median-of-three), Bottom‑Up Merge, Counting, Radix (LSD), Bucket, and Timsort Trace register themselves through a plugin registry. Each yields richly-typed `Step` objects so the UI, narration, and tests stay in lockstep.
- **Explanations panel**: Every algorithm tab renders a metadata card with traits, complexity table, and teaching notes so learners can connect what they see to theory at a glance.
- **Compare mode**: Launch a side-by-side view with linked controls to run two algorithms on the same input, with FPS/seed/preset kept in sync for apples-to-apples comparisons.
- **Deterministic presets**: Choose from uniform, nearly-sorted, reversed, few-unique, and more—each backed by a visible RNG seed so you can recreate runs or share them with students.
- **Deterministic replay**: Checkpoints capture array snapshots/metrics every *n* steps (`VizConfig.checkpoint_stride`). Seeking restores the nearest checkpoint, replays intervening steps, and guarantees the HUD, highlights, and narration remain coherent.
- **Accessible themes**: Flip between the original dark palette and a high-contrast light mode; tooltips, HUD, and legends all re-tint automatically for readability.
- **Manual & automated playback**: `Step ▶`/`Step ◀` buttons advance or rewind one step at a time (even before a full run), while the timer provides smooth animation at user-selected FPS. Scrubbing, keyboard shortcuts, and narration updates respect both modes.
- **Color-coded semantics**: Dedicated highlight channels clarify intent:
  - Cyan = key being inserted (`Step("key", ...)`)
  - Orange = shift writes during insertion (`Step("shift", ...)`)
  - Yellow = comparisons
  - Red = swaps
  - Green = pivots / finish confirmations
  - Violet = merge ranges
  A legend beneath the log explains the palette in the running app.
- **Robust crash handling**: A hardened `sys.excepthook` writes to a rotating log under the user’s log directory (via `platformdirs`) and displays a critical dialog only when a `QApplication` exists.
- **Persistence**: User FPS, last input array, window geometry, and UI theme preferences round-trip automatically through `QSettings` (`org.pysort/sorting-visualizer`).
- **Production toolchain**: `ruff`, `black`, `mypy --strict`, and `pytest` all pass; algorithms are validated with property-based tests, determinism checks, and replay harnesses.
- **Export & benchmark**: One-click export to CSV/JSON/PNG/GIF plus a built-in benchmark runner that sweeps every algorithm for the active preset/seed and writes a CSV report.

## Installation & First Run

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate             # Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt       # or: pip install -e ".[dev]"
python main.py
```

> **Tip:** Always launch through `python main.py`. The script wires up `QApplication` with the correct organization/app identifiers so QSettings and logging land in predictable locations.

The application has been verified on macOS 14, Windows 11, and Ubuntu 24.10 with Python 3.10+. Property tests rely on `hypothesis`; headless execution uses Qt’s “offscreen” platform via the pytest fixture in `tests/conftest.py`.

## Feature Tour

### Algorithm Registry
- `src/app/algos/registry.py` exposes a frozen `AlgoInfo` dataclass (`name`, `stable`, `in_place`, `comparison`, `complexity`, `description`, `notes`) and a decorator-based registration API.
- Clients import `app.algos.<algo>`; module import side-effects populate `REGISTRY` and `INFO` dictionaries keyed by human-readable names (“Bubble Sort”, “Insertion Sort”…).
- The app window iterates sorted `INFO` keys to build tabs dynamically. Tests do the same to guarantee coverage for every registered algorithm.

### Explanations Panel
- Each `AlgoInfo` entry now carries a human-readable description plus highlight bullets.
- `AlgorithmVisualizerBase` renders the metadata card beside the canvas, showing traits (stable/in-place/comparison), complexity table, and notes.
- The panel updates automatically with new algorithms, keeping documentation, narration, and UI in sync.

### Modular Launcher
- The application now starts with a launcher window, allowing users to choose between different modes: a single algorithm visualizer, a compare mode, and a planned dataset batch mode.
- The UI has been refactored into a modular structure with separate modules for the single view (`ui_single`), compare view (`ui_compare`), and shared UI elements (`ui_shared`).

### Compare Mode
- Launched from the main launcher, the “Compare” tab embeds two visualizers in a linked split view.
- Shared controls drive both algorithms: seed-safe generation, play/pause, single-step, and resets remain synchronised.
- Algorithm selectors make it easy to juxtapose stable vs. unstable variants or explore different complexity classes side by side.

### Data Presets & Seeds
- `app/presets` defines reusable dataset generators (uniform, nearly-sorted, reverse runs, few unique, etc.).
- The toolbar exposes a preset picker and seed field; generated runs log the preset + seed and surface them in the HUD.
- Benchmarks reuse the same presets so CLI research and GUI demos stay aligned.

### Export & Benchmarking
- `Export…` writes the active trace to CSV (steps), JSON (full session), PNG (snapshot), or GIF (animated playback).
- The `Benchmark` button sweeps every registered algorithm for the chosen preset/seed (three runs by default) and emits a CSV with step counts, comparisons, swaps, runtime, and correctness flags.
- Outputs reuse the same deterministic presets so you can compare traces with colleagues or automate grading pipelines.

### Step Contract (`Step` dataclass)
Supported operations currently include:
- `compare(i, j)` — increments comparison counter, paints indices yellow.
- `swap(i, j)` — mutates the array, increments swap counter, paints red.
- `pivot(p)` — highlights quicksort pivots.
- `merge_mark(lo, hi)` — violet band for the merge subsequence.
- `merge_compare(i, j, payload=k)` — compare + mark destination index.
- `set(k, payload=value)` — writes a value (merge final placement, insertion drop-in).
- `shift(k, payload=value)` — visually distinct orange write (insertion shift).
- `key(i, payload=value)` / `key()` — cyan highlight for the held insertion key (empty tuple clears highlight).
- `confirm(i)` — finish sweep coloring.

All algorithms operate on the same contract; replay code treats `shift` exactly like `set` for state reconstruction.

### Visualization Canvas
- Stateless `VisualizationCanvas` queries `AlgorithmVisualizerBase._get_canvas_state()` each paint cycle. The state contains the live array, highlight tuples, confirmed indices, and HUD metrics.
- Bars render gap-aware and scale with window size. Highlight precedence ensures confirm > key > shift > swap > compare > pivot > merge > base.
- A HUD (top-left) displays algorithm name, `n`, FPS, comparison/swap totals, and elapsed seconds; the bottom-right legend clarifies colors.
- Optional value labels draw on each bar when the user toggles “Show values” or when a finished array has ≤40 elements.

### Manual Step Control & Narration
- `Step ▶` button (or → key) advances even if the timer never ran. The first press parses input, captures checkpoints, and primes the generator. Subsequent presses consume existing recorded steps before pulling more from the generator.
- `Step ◀` rewinds by replaying from the last checkpoint to the desired index; UI state, narration, and highlights reflect the exact historical step.
- Narration sentences derive from `_narrate_step`, using `safe_get` to guard against out-of-range indices after scrubbing.

### Persistence & Logging
- `VizConfig.from_settings()` merges environment overrides (`SORT_VIZ_*`) with QSettings values, coercing types with `typing.get_type_hints` to respect postponed annotations.
- FPS slider value, recent input, and theme are persisted automatically once changed.
- Logs (`sorting_viz.log`) rotate at 1 MB ×5, written to `platformdirs.user_log_dir("sorting-visualizer", "org.pysort")` or the workspace `logs/` fallback. Crash dialogs only display when a GUI app instance exists; otherwise a stderr message prompts the user to check the log.

### Tests
- `pytest -q` exercises deterministic behaviour, property checks (Hypothesis up to 60 integers, −1000..1000), and step replay invariants.
- `mypy src` runs under `--strict`; Qt stubs are ignored via `ignore_missing_imports = true` to work around incomplete PyQt6 type hints.
- `ruff` (style, pyupgrade, import sort) and `black` keep the codebase consistent; add them to your own pre-commit hooks if you want automatic formatting.
- A standalone Apple NEON radix-sieve sample lives in `native/radix_simd.cpp`. Build it with `clang++` on Apple silicon for SIMD experimentation separate from the PyQt application.

## Algorithms in Detail

| Algorithm             | Stable | In-Place | Type         | Complexity (best / avg / worst)       | Highlights                                                                             |
|-----------------------|:------:|:--------:|--------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bubble Sort           | ✓      | ✓        | Comparison   | `O(n)` / `O(n²)` / `O(n²)`            | Yellow comparisons, red swaps; early-exit when a pass has zero swaps.                 |
| Insertion Sort        | ✓      | ✓        | Comparison   | `O(n)` / `O(n²)` / `O(n²)`            | Cyan key highlight, orange shifts, green placement confirmation, yellow compares.    |
| Selection Sort        | ✗      | ✓        | Comparison   | `O(n²)` / `O(n²)` / `O(n²)`           | Tracks current minimum with a cyan key; confirms ends of the array first.            |
| Heap Sort             | ✗      | ✓        | Comparison   | `O(n log n)` / `O(n log n)` / `O(n log n)` | Max-heap build and sift-down steps recorded with compare/swap events.             |
| Shell Sort            | ✗      | ✓        | Comparison   | `O(n log n)` / `O(n²)` / `O(n²)`       | Gap-based insertion with `shift` events; final `key()` clears highlight.             |
| Cocktail Shaker Sort  | ✓      | ✓        | Comparison   | `O(n)` / `O(n²)` / `O(n²)`            | Bi-directional bubble passes; ends get confirmed after each sweep.                   |
| Comb Sort             | ✗      | ✓        | Comparison   | `O(n log n)` / `O(n²)` / `O(n²)`       | Shrinking gap (factor 1.3) removes turtles; finish sweep confirms every element.     |
| Quick Sort            | ✗      | ✓        | Comparison   | `O(n log n)` / `O(n log n)` / `O(n²)` | Median-of-three pivot selection, pivots highlighted green, swaps recorded with payloads. |
| Merge Sort            | ✓      | ✗        | Comparison   | `O(n log n)` / `O(n log n)` / `O(n log n)` | Violet merge windows, yellow comparisons, orange merge writes, deterministic bottom-up passes. |
| Timsort Trace         | ✓      | ✗        | Comparison   | `O(n)` / `O(n log n)` / `O(n log n)`   | Detects runs (via insertion sort) then merges them; approximates Python's Timsort trace. |
| Counting Sort         | ✓      | ✗        | Non-comparison | `O(n + k)` / `O(n + k)` / `O(n + k)` | Uses buckets indexed by value; writes back with `set` + cyan key highlights.         |
| Radix Sort (LSD)      | ✓      | ✗        | Non-comparison | `O(d(n + k))` across passes           | Offsets negatives once, then leverages stable per-digit counting to churn through integers efficiently; every placement is streamed via `set`. |
| Bucket Sort           | ✓      | ✗        | Non-comparison | `O(n)` / `O(n + k)` / `O(n²)`         | Normalizes values into buckets, sorts locally, replays as stable writes.             |

These stability and in-place columns reflect the classical algorithmic properties (not implementation bugs): Bubble and Insertion Sort are naturally stable and in-place, Quick Sort (with standard Lomuto partition) is not stable but remains in-place, and Bottom-Up Merge Sort is stable but requires auxiliary storage.

Each implementation mutates its working copy in sync with emitted steps so that `apply_step_sequence(original, steps)` equals both the generator’s final array and Python’s `sorted(original)`.

### Performance Notes

- **Linear-time specialists.** Counting Sort and Radix Sort (LSD) excel on integer datasets when the range (`k`) or number of digits (`d`) remain modest. Radix offsets negatives a single time and then streams stable per-digit counting passes, making it a go-to choice for large integer workloads.
- **Distribution-aware Bucket Sort.** Bucket Sort normalizes values into `n` buckets and sorts inside each bucket using Python’s highly optimised Timsort. It performs best when values are uniformly distributed; in adversarial cases where all elements land in one bucket, the complexity degrades toward quadratic.
- **Run-aware Timsort trace.** The Timsort trace algorithm models Python’s hybrid sorter by detecting short ascending runs (sorted via insertion sort) before merging them with a merge-sort style pass. It achieves linear time on already sorted data and stays `O(n log n)` in the worst case.
- **Gap-based accelerators.** Shell Sort and Comb Sort reduce “turtles” (small values trapped near the end of the array) far faster than pure quadratic sorts by comparing elements `gap` positions apart before finishing with insertion/bubble behaviour.
- **General-purpose workhorses.** Quick Sort remains the fastest comparison sort on average, Heap Sort guarantees `O(n log n)` regardless of input, and Merge Sort provides stability with predictable performance.
- **Nearly sorted data.** Insertion Sort and Cocktail Shaker Sort run in linear time when the input is almost sorted. Bubble and Selection Sort remain in the suite mainly as pedagogical baselines.

## Running & Developing

### Launching the App
- Enter integers separated by commas *or* leave blank and click **Randomize**.
- Use **Show values** to annotate bars; the app auto-enables labels after the last step when `n ≤ 40`.
- Scrub, step, or let the animation play; narration keeps up in all modes.
- Click **Export CSV** to capture the entire `Step` trace (index, op, indices, payload).

### Running the QA Suite
```bash
ruff check src tests
black src tests
mypy src
pytest -q
```

### Adding a New Algorithm
1. Create `src/app/algos/<name>.py` with a generator returning `Iterator[Step]`.
2. Decorate the function with `@register(AlgoInfo(...))` and provide accurate metadata.
3. Update `src/app/app.py` and the test modules’ import list (or rely on module discovery if you add automated import logic).
4. Emit existing ops (`compare`, `swap`, `set`, etc.) or introduce new ones — just update `Step`, `_apply_step`, the canvas color map, and tests accordingly.
5. Add property tests if the algorithm introduces new invariants (e.g., counting sort ranges, heap property).
